# Contributing to ISP Outage Map

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/public-outage-map.git
   cd public-outage-map
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm
- A Mapbox account (free tier is fine)
- Git

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

npm run preview
```

## Code Style and Standards

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Follow existing code formatting (2 spaces for indentation)
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Avoid using frameworks - this is a vanilla JS project

### CSS

- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM-like naming conventions where appropriate
- Keep selectors specific but not overly complex
- Support both light and dark modes

### HTML

- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA labels, alt text, etc.)
- Keep markup clean and well-indented
